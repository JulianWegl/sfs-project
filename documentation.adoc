== Flags

The flag *CTF{CHALLENGE-COMPLETE-CONGRATULATIONS}* is hidden in the in memory *H2* database.
The tables for the database are initialized in the *Initializer* java class in the *at.fh.sfs.service* package.
Hence also the row containing the flag is initialized there.

Normally, this flag can not be reached. But there is a backup mechanism built in, if the someone tries to save a new product,
which refers to a category for which no category information was defined yet. This data is stored in the table *ProductInformation*.

The categories themselfs are defined as a Java enum. Hence the REST request must describe a valid value for this enum.
The attacker can extract the valid values from an exception, which bubbles up to the REST interface. Therefore it is visible to the attacker in the REST response.


.Backup Mechanism
[source, java]
--
Optional<ProductInformation> info = getInformation(newProduct.getCategory());

if (info.isEmpty() && isAdmin) {
    info = getBackupV1(newProduct).map(p -> backupToPrimary(p, newProduct.getCategory()));
}

if (info.isEmpty()) throw new IllegalArgumentException(
        "Cannot retrieve information for product category '" + newProduct.getCategory().name() + "'. Use elevated privileges to retrieve additional information."
);
--

As shown in the code snippet above, if no category information is found for the category of the new product, an *IllegalArgumentException* is thrown.
This exception again bubbles up to the REST interface.

The attacker can then user the information contained within the exception message,
to get an hint that this issue could be circumvented by having "elevetad privileges". From this info, one can conclude that there must be some kind of admin user.

In this scenario, the *default user admin with password admin* still exists within the database. So after the attacker figured this out, he can provide this credentials to the
rest request. This then triggers the if-statement from above to become true -> the method *getBackupV1* is called.

The method *getBackupV1* uses a *Hibernate Native Query* to gather data from a backup table. When the attacker knows where to place the text for the
SQL-Injection (property "Information" of the Product), the table *ProductInformationBackup which contains the flag* can be read (and possibly other tables.)

.Vulnerable native query
[source,java]
--
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    private Optional<ProductInformationBackup> getBackupV1(Product product) {
        String sqlQuery = String.format("SELECT * from %s target WHERE target.information = '%s'",
                ProductInformationBackup.class.getSimpleName(), product.getInformation());

        List<ProductInformationBackup> matches = (List<ProductInformationBackup>) this.entityManager
                .createNativeQuery(sqlQuery, ProductInformationBackup.class)
                .getResultList();

        if (matches.isEmpty()) return Optional.empty();

        return Optional.of(matches.getFirst());
    }

== Exploit

The application exposes only a single endpoint over which the exploit is performed.

The exploit consists of two parts:

. Exploitation of a leftover admin account
. Exploitation of SQL injection

The endpoint in question takes a product,
which is defined by its `Category` and `Information` and attaches additional information from an internal data-source.

This additional information is stored in a separate table,
which does not store information about the `FLOWERS` category.

If the products category is not found within the primary table and if the current user is an `admin`,
then the backup table is used to retrieve the missing data.
But this backup-table has the problem that its query is vulnerable to SQL injection.

Using this information, the exploit is as follows:

* The exploiter disguises themselves as an `admin` by setting both the query parameters `userName` and `passwd` to "admin"
* The exploitative request body is as follows:
+
.Bad Request
[source,json]
--
{
  "category": "FLOWERS",
  "information": "' OR target.information LIKE 'CTF%' -- "
}
--

** The category is set to `FLOWERS`, a category which is not stored within the primary table,
thus the application defaults to the backup table.

** Since the backup table builds its query using string concatenation and the `information` field, it can be exploited.
+
The string used for exploitation is the following: "' OR target.information LIKE 'CTF%' -- ".
Which first closes of the actual comparison operator and then selects the flag.
+
Additionally, since the backup table uses incremental IDs and the flag is the first entry to be inserted,
the following information-string would also work: "' OR 1=1 -- ".

* After these steps, the flag is then returned inside the `basicInformation` field of the response.
